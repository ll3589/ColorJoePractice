# ColorJoePractice
Practiced creating a color picker
This is my first colorwheel practice. I coded along with this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGth988Sm8w
and used the color joe library: https://github.com/bebraw/colorjoe
made small modifications based on the mac keyboard. This is for practice only.
